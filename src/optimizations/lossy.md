# Lossy optimizations

What **trades fidelity for fit**: something RM2k draws or plays is drawn
or played a little differently so that the game fits the console.

A game made for a PC asks for things a Super Nintendo doesn't have: more
colors in a window than a palette holds, more distinct tiles than video
memory, more sounds than the sound chip can index. The tools treat each of
those limits the same way: **lose the least, say so, and keep building**.
The build prints a warning naming what was lost, and what was decided is
written down next to the game —the converter's log, the game's
`build/<cartridge>/adeleine/` images, its patches—, so it can be reviewed
and changed.

Refusing to build would be the safer-looking answer, and the worse one: a
game that runs with a missing effect can be played, measured and fixed; a
game that doesn't build can only be guessed about.

## What a game can choose

Some of those choices belong to the game, not the tools, and are knobs in
its `rm2k-snes.toml`:

- **Another System graphic**, when the game's own is not the one the port
  should show, or costs what the cartridge doesn't have: one from the
  game, from the RTP, or one made for the port.
- **A background of its own for a System's windows**, a colour or a
  gradient: see [the windows' background, a colour of the
  project's](lossy/tiles.md#the-windows-background-a-colour-of-the-projects).
- **Decorative events as background**: see [decorative events become
  background](lossy/events.md#decorative-events-become-background). It is off by default,
  because it changes how those maps are drawn.

What is left out of an event page that uses a command the console can't
run yet is not an optimization but a gap: it is in [The engine against
RPG Maker 2000](../progress/engine-vs-rm2k.md), and the converter's report
lists, for every map, which commands keep which pages out.
