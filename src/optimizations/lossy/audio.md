# Lossy: audio

## Each sample at the rate its worst package allows

Each package with its effects has to fit in the 64 KB of ARAM, so a sample
gets the rate its fullest package leaves; where a package lacks some of
the tracks that use a sample, those play a copy that does not pay for it.

- **Loses**: instrument brightness where packages are full.
- **Where**: `allocate` and `copies` in `bank.rs` of
  `rm2k-snes/rm2k-snes-audio/`.
- **More**: [A single sample bank](../lossless/audio/the-sample-bank.md).

## Past 256 samples, the least used are dropped

The SPC700 indexes its samples with one byte; past that, the least used
are dropped and the notes that needed them are silent.

- **Loses**: those notes.
- **Where**: `compile.rs` of `rm2k-snes/rm2k-snes-audio/`.
- **More**: [Audio](../../internals/audio.md).

## A package whose music would go below 6 kHz is relieved

A map whose package only fits in the ARAM with its music below 6 kHz
—the sound effects' own rate— is relieved instead: its songs are uploaded
when a `PlayBGM` asks for them, with a pause, and the last effects of its
list are left out until the music fits at 6 kHz next to the rest. The
Frozen World's map 1, with 41 sound effects and six songs, did not fit
even at the lowest rate; A Blurred Line's map 3 did, with `evilrhys` at
4.5 kHz, and since 2026-10-16 it is relieved too —taro's, by ear: "4k is
too little"—.

- **Loses**: a pause at those `PlayBGM`s, and the effects left out, each
  named in `degradations.json`.
- **Where**: `relief.rs` of `rm2k-snes/rm2k-snes-audio/`.
- **More**: [Audio](../../internals/audio.md).

## Sound effects borrow two of the music's voices

No voice is kept for the sound effects: a `PlaySound` takes voice 7 or 6
from the music while it lasts, and gives it back with the registers the
music wrote to it meanwhile. The voice allocation fills those two first
with percussion hits, which are short, and with melodic notes only when
no other voice is free.

- **Saves**: voices —the music has all eight while nothing else plays—.
- **Loses**: what the music plays on that voice while the effect lasts;
  without MSU-1, a third effect cuts one of the two.
- **Where**: `EFFECT_VOICES` in `rm2k-snes/rm2k-snes-audio/src/voices.rs`;
  `dsp_music`, `se_before` and `se_after` in `runtime/sound_effects.s`.
- **More**: [Audio](../../internals/audio.md).

## A song the map plays only to leave, or apart, goes up alone

The songs a map turns on only to leave it, and those a project declares
in `[music] apart_themes`, do not count in the map's package: when their
`PlayBGM` asks for one that is not there, it is uploaded alone —an exit
song letting go of the rest of the package, a separate one with the
package's effects— and the next `PlayBGM` completes the package.

- **Saves**: ARAM, which the package's other samples get as rate.
- **Loses**: a pause at that `PlayBGM`, while the song uploads.
- **Where**: `Songs::exit_songs` in `rm2k-snes/rm2k-snes-audio/src/cartridge.rs`;
  `exit_extra`, `extra_separate` and `song_ensure` in
  `runtime/audio_package.s`.
- **More**: [A single sample bank](../lossless/audio/the-sample-bank.md),
  [Audio](../../internals/audio.md).
