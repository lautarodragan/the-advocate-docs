# Lossy: colours

## Adeleine merges the least visible colours

A map or a System with more colours than its palettes hold has its least
visible colours merged into their nearest, by how many pixels each covers.
A lone tile with more than fifteen colours cannot fit a 4-bit palette
however many there are, so this is the only way out for it.

- **Loses**: a shade here and there, chosen where it covers the fewest
  pixels.
- **Where**: `reduce_colors` in `snes/adeleine/src/pack.rs`; what it
  decided stays in the game's patches.
- **More**: [The CGRAM split](../../internals/cgram.md).

## The message window takes its colours from every background

The message window lives in CGRAM palette 0, which in mode 3 is also the
background's, so its colours —background, frame, text, shadow, the arrow
and the cursor— come out of every map's budget, and a map that needed
those entries merges colours.

- **Loses**: on some maps, a shadow takes the shade next to it.
- **Where**: `window_colors`, counted by `rm2k-snes-screens window`;
  `cgram_reserved` in `rm2k-snes/wally/src/background/layers.rs`.
- **More**: [The window takes thirteen colors from every background](../../divergences/the-window-takes-thirteen-colors-from-every-background.md).

## An event without a palette borrows one

Every event is drawn: one that does not get its own palette takes the one
it is drawn nearest with —each pixel of the poses the map shows, times how
far its colour lands—, each missing colour going to its nearest as it
looks, in CIE Lab. Until 2026-10-17 it took the one it missed the fewest
pixels of, over all twelve poses, and the nearest was by luma, which
barely sees blue: a chest of greys on A Blurred Line's map 38 was drawn
golden. The measurements of the change are in [The palette a character is
lent](../../research/2026-10-17-the-palette-a-character-is-lent.md).

- **Loses**: some colours of the borrowing graphic.
- **Where**: `drawable_npcs` in `rm2k-snes/wally/src/sprites/split.rs`.
- **More**: [Every event is drawn](../../decisions/every-event-is-drawn.md),
  the principle; [A graphic that doesn't fit isn't drawn](../../decisions/a-graphic-that-doesnt-fit-isnt-drawn.md).

## The timer borrows a character's palette

The timer has no palette of its own: its digits go into the palette of
any character that uses thirteen colours or fewer. Having one cost an
undrawn event on ABL's map 2 —the middle cell of the door Core breaks—.

On a map that fills the eight palettes at fifteen colours, room is made by
lowering a character to fourteen —the one that moves the fewest pixels,
never a leader, and only in a palette with a single character—. If not
even that is enough —every palette full, and each shared or lent—, the
timer is **lent** a palette, as an event is: the one whose nearest colours
change the digits the least, each glyph colour drawn with its nearest, and
the converter says which in a warning. It only stops if all eight palettes
are the leaders'.

Since the palette belongs to a character, the tint cannot skip it whole:
`upload_timer_pal` uploads untinted only the digits' entries, and only
while they are visible.

- **Loses**: the colours the character shares with the digits go untinted
  while the timer is visible; when lent, the digits' exact colours.
- **Where**: the end of `drawable_npcs` in
  `rm2k-snes/wally/src/sprites/split.rs`, `timer_digits` in
  `rm2k-snes/wally/src/sprites/extras.rs`; `upload_timer_pal` in
  `runtime/tint.s`.
- **More**: [The timer and its neighbor share colors](../../divergences/the-timer-and-its-neighbor-share-colors.md);
  the idea of reserving a palette only while the timer runs, in the task
  [`timer-palette`](https://github.com/lautarodragan/the-advocate-work/blob/main/tasks/timer-palette.md).

## The raindrops are lent a palette

The drops are three greys, a 4x16 streak each, and they go into the first
sprite palette with room for the three —never a leader's, which the
console overwrites, nor the timer's, which is uploaded untinted—, or a new
one. With no room anywhere they are **lent** one, as the timer is: each
palette takes in the greys it has room for, the farthest from what it has
first, and the one whose nearest colours are then closest to the rest
wins; what it still lacks is drawn with its nearest, and the converter
says so with `rain-colors-lent`. Nobody loses a colour for it.

Until 2026-10-17 such a map drew no rain: 47 of Vampires Dawn's, whose
rain is a parallel common event that can run on any map, and 32 of A
Blurred Line's, Paradise among them. taro's word that day is that the rain
is not given up. Near is measured in CIE Lab, as an event's lending is,
so a grey goes to a grey: most end up a step or two away, and where the
palette has a single grey the three shades are that one —Paradise, A
Blurred Line's 108, draws its drops in `[8, 8, 8]`—.

- **Loses**: the drops' exact greys, on the maps that lend, and on some
  their three shades.
- **Where**: `rain_drops` and `lend_to_rain` in
  `rm2k-snes/wally/src/sprites/extras.rs`.
- **More**: the task [`rain-drops-cost-a-cache-its-slots`](https://github.com/lautarodragan/the-advocate-work/blob/main/tasks/rain-drops-cost-a-cache-its-slots.md).

## Seven palettes on a map with battle animations

The battle animation's box needs a sprite palette to itself, so on maps
that show animations the characters share seven.

- **Loses**: a merged colour or two in those maps' characters.
- **Where**: `palette_cap` in `rm2k-snes/wally/src/map.rs`.
- **More**: [Seven palettes on a map with animations](../../divergences/seven-palettes-on-a-map-with-animations.md).

## The screen flash changes every other frame

A screen flash is a CGRAM transform of the map's three palettes, and
running all of them does not fit in a frame with everything else, so it
takes two: the background and the layer above on one frame, the sprites
and the upload on the next. What is seen changes every other frame.

- **Loses**: half the steps of the fade, which RM2k draws every frame.
- **Saves**: the frames a flash would lose.
- **Where**: `flash_tick` in `runtime/screen_flash.s`.
- **More**: the header of `runtime/screen_flash.s`;
