# Decisions

Decisions that were made and still hold.

One page per decision: **what was decided, why, and what was measured to
decide it**. They are the ones you need to know so as not to redo them or
contradict them, and that is why they live apart from the tasks: they
aren't half-done work, they are the floor the work stands on. What stays
here is the decision and its reason; **how it was reached is in the
record** —the `git log` of the repos, which is there for that—. When a
decision protects one specific line of code, its reason lives in that
line's comment and isn't repeated here.

What does **not** go here: what we would like to do and nobody is doing,
which is the wishlist of tasks in the-advocate-work; where the ROM doesn't do
what RM2k does, which is [the divergences](../divergences/README.md); and
what is half done today, which is the tasks in progress; and **what only
saves** —ROM, RAM, VRAM, colours, CPU time— once it is settled, which is
[the optimizations](../optimizations/README.md): since 2026-10-15 the
decisions that were only that live there, as entries. If a decision
stops holding because a later one replaced it, **it isn't edited
silently**: it is changed saying which one replaced it, or it is deleted
and the commit message tells it.

The decisions of **A Blurred Line** —what its cartridge carries, what is
done with its content— are in
[their own section](../ports/abl/decisions/README.md), under the port.
From 2026-10-02 to 2026-10-10 they lived in the game's repo, with a copy of
the mixed ones in both; that day they came back together with the rest, and
in the book they are separated again. Mixed ones —an engine rule measured
on ABL— are here.

The file names were in Spanish, as they were written, until 2026-10-12,
when they got English ones made from their titles. An old citation
—`decisiones/<name>.md`, in a commit or an old task— is looked up in the
redirect table of `book.toml` (see [Contributing](../contributing/README.md)).
