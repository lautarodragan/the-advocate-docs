# A teleport to a map not carried

## What

When a `Teleport` names a map the cartridge does not carry, **it shows a
message box instead of going**: `Teleport to missing map N`, N being the map's
RM2k id. The hero stays where he is, and the page goes on after the box.

Until 2026-10-15 the whole page was left out. A game whose fighting happens on
maps that are excluded —The Frozen World's 1 and 2— lost every page that
could take the hero there, and with them everything else those pages did.

## Why

A page that does nothing is a hole nobody can see; a box says where the hole
is. The converter also warns, one line per map, with how many such teleports
there are and to which maps.

A map is not carried when the game's project excludes it, or since
2026-10-17 when its grid does not fit in WRAM even one byte a cell: the
converter leaves it out on its own, with a warning and a `map-left-out` in
`degradations.json` (see [Maps](../internals/maps.md)).

## How it looks today

The box is an ordinary `ShowMessage`, so its text goes to the text block like
any other. Nothing else about the teleport happens: no fade, no song change,
no new map. Only the screen: if an event erased it before the jump, it is
shown again with the cut before the box. An erased screen is black over the
windows too, as in RPG_RT, and a game that erases it before a `Teleport`
leaves the showing to the destination; until 2026-10-17 the box waited for A
in the black and the screen stayed black after it —Zounds' bed, whose dream,
map 30, was left out until the same day—. It is only the `Teleport`: `MemorizeLocation` names no map, and
`ChangeVehicleLocation` is not compiled at all.
