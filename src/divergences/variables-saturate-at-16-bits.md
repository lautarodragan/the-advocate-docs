# Variables saturate at sixteen bits

## What

The console keeps RM2k's variables in **sixteen bits, signed**: from
-32,768 to 32,767, against RM2k's ±9,999,999. A `ControlVars` that **sets**
a constant outside that range is compiled as setting the nearest edge:
999999 becomes 32,767. Adding or subtracting a constant outside the range
still does not compile, and its page is left out, because the ROM's sum
wraps around instead of capping.

## Why

The one command that asks for it is common event 45 of A Blurred Line,
`SimClearTweenRooms`, which sets six variables to 999999 as "no cell"; the
rooms of Eisen's simulation call it 47 times. While it did not compile, each
of those calls was skipped ([A skipped call](a-skipped-call.md)) and the
variables stayed at whatever they had.

Those six variables are only compared for equality against an event's or
the hero's cell, and only moved by one after being set from a cell. A cell
never reaches 32,767, so the ceiling says "no cell" the same way 999999
does. Widening every variable to 32 bits would double their RAM and the
cost of every operation for one sentinel.

## How it applies

* What is lost is the exact value: a game that sets 999999 and then shows
  it with `\V[n]`, or compares it against something above 32,767, sees
  something else. No page of A Blurred Line does.
* Multiplying clamps to the word, as RM2k clamps to its own range: the
  product is taken whole, in 32 bits, and what passes 32,767 or -32,768
  stays at the edge (easyrpg's `VarMult`). Dividing and the modulo cannot
  leave the word, except -32,768 / -1, which clamps the same way. What
  is lost is a product that a later command brings back into range: The
  Frozen World's HP percentages are the HP times 100 divided by the
  maximum, and with more than 327 HP the product stays at 32,767, so the
  percentage comes out low. That is the combat, which is not in the
  cartridge yet. Dividing or taking the modulo **by** a constant past the
  word compiles since 2026-11-01, and exactly for a word: the quotient is
  0 and the remainder the variable itself, as C's `/` and `%`, which RPG_RT
  uses, give for any dividend smaller than the divisor —except dividing
  by 32,768, since -32,768 / 32,768 is -1, which does not compile—.
  Nothing is lost there beyond the word itself: Zounds splits its money
  and its experience in digits with `mod 100000` and `/ 100000` (common
  events 26, 62 and 63), and a word never holds a sixth digit. The compiler is the same `ControlVars`; the ROM,
  `var_arith` in `runtime/variable_arithmetic.s`; the test,
  `test_multiply_divide_and_modulo_are_rm2ks`.
* An actor's experience copied into a variable —`ControlVars` from an
  actor, number 1, since 2026-10-16— is capped at 32,767 the same way:
  RM2k's reaches 999,999. The compiler notes it on the page as
  `variable-saturated`, because at run time it is silent. Zounds' common
  event 3 copies its hero's every frame, into variable 79, which the
  game shows and compares against the next level's.
* The gold copied into a variable was already capped at 32,767 —`op_var`,
  in `runtime/interpreter_variables.s` in the-advocate—, for the same
  reason: Sern's forge, which keeps the party's gold in a variable while
  it lends forge points, loses whatever is above that.
* The compiler is `ControlVars` in `compile.rs` of `rm2k-snes/events/` in
  the-advocate; the test is `test_putting_more_than_the_word_saturates` in A
  Blurred Line's suite.
