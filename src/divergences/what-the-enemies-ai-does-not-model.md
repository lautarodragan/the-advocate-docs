# What the enemies' AI does not model

## What

Since 2026-09-27 the enemies choose what to do like `Game_Enemy`: the LDB's
action list, each action's `rating` and easyrpg's
`SelectEnemyAiActionRpgRtCompat` —each candidate weighs
`max(0, rating - maximum + 10)`— and they use skills. It is decided by
`batalla.accion_del_enemigo` and copied by `ba_enemy_action`
(`runtime/battle.s` in the-advocate). What is still different:

* **With a single weighted action the die is not rolled.** RM2k rolls
  `rand(0, sum - 1)` anyway. It is the same distribution, and it leaves the
  randomness of the battles that already existed —enemies that only
  attack— exactly as it was: without it every hit of every battle in
  `release` changed. RPG_RT's generator is not ours either.
* **Only the basic attack and skills.** Defending, charging,
  self-destructing, fleeing, doing nothing, transforming and the double
  attack drop out of the list, as if their condition were not met. Switch
  skills, too.
* **Only the "always" condition.** Those on turn, HP, SP, number of enemies,
  party level and party fatigue take the action out of the list.
* **The switches an action turns on or off when chosen** (`switch_on`,
  `switch_off`) take the action out of the list.
* **A skill's conditions do not weigh in choosing it.** Since 2026-11-01
  a skill gives and takes them —see
  [What battle conditions do not model](what-battle-conditions-do-not-model.md)—,
  and one against the party is always chosen as easyrpg chooses it; but
  one on the enemies' own side that only takes conditions away is
  discarded as if it did nothing, where `IsSkillEffectiveOn` would look
  for a target that holds one. An enemy a condition restricts does what
  the condition says, as `SetStateRestrictedAction`: nothing, or attack a
  random one of either side.
* **No animation.** `ShortCircuit` carries number 62 and it is not drawn,
  same as the party's skills: see [`animations-in-battle`](https://github.com/lautarodragan/the-advocate-work/blob/main/tasks/animations-in-battle.md)
  in the-advocate-work.

If an enemy has no action left, it attacks, which is what they all did until
that day.

## Measured

On 2026-09-27, over the troops in `release` (`troop_id` in `mapdata.inc`),
16 enemies carried something besides the plain attack. With RM2k's weights
**four use a skill**: the Tangle Wire (`ShortCircuit`, half the time), the
KingRat of the Rat Tracks (`RoyalRatBite`, half: its double attack is
turn-based and drops out of the list), the Risen Dead (`PowerDrain`, a
third) and the Securibot Type I (`Static Shielding`, on itself, half). The
others carry one with ten or more points less than the attack, and would
never use it: the Scrapped Droid, the Trash Hauler and the plant's Junkbot,
among them.

It is enforced by `test_the_troop_is_the_expected_one` and
`test_the_tangle_wire_uses_short_circuit_and_leaves_the_models_hp`, in
`tests/rpgmaker/test_ag7_and_the_plant.py` in the ABL port
(the-advocate-ports/abl), and by `test_the_plant_battle` in
`test_cores.py`.

## How it looks today

In the plant, the Tangle Wire alternates between hitting and "ShortCircuit";
the other three in the plant only hit, which is what they would do in RM2k.
The boss of the Rat Tracks bites.

## When it stops being enough

An enemy whose battle depends on a condition —a boss that changes actions by
turn or when low on health— or that defends or flees.
