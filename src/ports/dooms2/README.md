# Dooms 2

## Known issues

What playing the port shows today that the original does not. It is kept
current: whoever fixes one removes its line in the same change. The work
behind each one is a draft or a task in the tasks repository, named here
as text.

* **Three characters have no face in the pause menu and in the save
  slots**: Will (actor 9) and the two Junes (10 and 11), the candidates
  the story unlocks last. With map 1 in the cartridge the party can hold
  eleven actors, and their ten faces plus the screens' text ask for more
  tiles than the bank has, so the converter leaves faces out, the last
  actors' first, instead of stopping —`faces-left-out` in
  `degradations.json`—. Since 2026-10-16; until then map 1 was out and the
  game started on map 2 with Will always in the party. Task:
  [`dooms-2-slots-and-menu-dont-fit-in-their-bank`](https://github.com/lautarodragan/the-advocate-work/blob/main/tasks/dooms-2-slots-and-menu-dont-fit-in-their-bank.md).
* **Losing after the game changes the Game Over song plays the default
  one**: one `ChangeSystemBGM` gives it "Everlasting battle with Jack". Task:
  [`change-system-bgm-of-the-game-over-is-ignored`](https://github.com/lautarodragan/the-advocate-work/blob/main/tasks/change-system-bgm-of-the-game-over-is-ignored.md).
* **Winning a battle with its own theme may stop the picture a moment**,
  while the victory song, which is another, is uploaded. Not measured.

## What it leaves out (2026-10-11)

> Since 2026-10-16 map 1 is in and the game starts on it: see "Known
> issues". What follows is the snapshot of 2026-10-11, kept as it was.

One map, and its error doesn't name it —it was checked by putting it
back alone—:

- **1**, choosing a character: "the slot screen and the menu gather 524
  tiles and their bank fits 448". So the cartridge still starts on map 2.

Maps 10, 14 and 63 are back: two of the game's songs, Graig and Demons,
have more than 256 sounds, and a note named its sound in one byte. Now
the stream says which 256 the notes name, with `OP_SOUND_PAGE` (see
[Audio](../../internals/audio.md)). Nobody has played those maps in an
emulator; what was checked is that the ROM writes to the DSP what the
stream of both songs says, start to end.

Since later on 2026-10-11 it builds with its own System: the actor
choice's windows, 69 tiles for a bank of 64, have their least visible
cells merged —[A window with a gradient is fused until it fits](../../optimizations/lossy/tiles/a-window-with-a-gradient.md)—.
Map 1 is not the windows' business: with its own System its slot screen
and menu gather 482 tiles of 448, and those are faces.

## As of 2026-10-10

> Measured again on 2026-10-10 ([Other games, measured again](../../research/2026-10-10-other-games-measured-again.md),
> with the tools of the-advocate `1afe6457` and the ports at `951471f`),
> without fixing anything. What follows the next heading is the snapshot
> of 2026-10-06, kept as it was.

- **The cartridge builds** with A Blurred Line's System and starting on
  map 2. With its own System, the actor choice's windows reach `$4840` and
  their tilemap is at `$4800`.
- **It only needs 1, 10, 14 and 63 out**: map 1 (choosing a character)
  makes the slot screen and the menu gather 524 tiles of 448, and the other
  three have a song with more than 255 sounds. The committed project still
  leaves out 45, 58 and 59 too, which build now.
- **Each map**, next to the start map: 89 of 93, the same four.
- **The pages that compile**: 482 of 496 on the maps (341 on 2026-10-05),
  10 of 10 common events, 1 of 82 troop pages. What is left:
  `ChangeScreenTransitions`, a few routes, `EnterHeroName`, `PlayMovie`.
- **What degrades**: "it doesn't rain here" in 82 maps, and the faces.

## As of 2026-10-06

> **A snapshot as of 2026-10-06.** What the survey of 2026-10-05 found
> ([Other games: the survey](../../research/2026-10-05-other-games.md),
> measured on `24e0223e` of the-advocate) and what the tasks that followed it
> changed up to 2026-10-06. It doesn't describe the port after that date.

The project is `dooms2/` in the-advocate-ports, without MSU-1 and without
tests (see [Ports](../README.md)).

## The game

93 maps, in English, with 53 MIDI themes and no `Harmony.dll`. It has
three BMP images and one `PlayMovie`. No DynRPG, no custom fonts, an RM2k
database.

## What the survey found (2026-10-05)

- **Crutches**: its own System reduced to 12 colors, because it doesn't
  fit the window's palette, and the BMPs turned into PNGs (RM2k accepts
  BMP; `rm2k-render` refused it on purpose, for lack of anything to test it
  against), both in a copy of the game.
- **Each map alone**: 89 of the 93 build a cartridge; a theme with more
  than 255 sounds cuts 3, and the names of the menu cut 1, the starting
  one.
- **The cartridge**: starting on map **2**, 86 of the 93; out are 1, 10, 14,
  45, 58, 59 and 63. Map 1, choosing a character, doesn't build: it asks
  for more names than the menu's bank holds. With neighbors, maps 2 and 3
  go over `ROUTE_GFX_MAX`.
- **Boot**: of the maps that build alone, 30 of 89 would need more than
  the 44 frames of `BOOT_FRAMES` if they were the starting map.
- **The pages that compile**: 341 of 496 on the maps, 10 of 10 common
  events, 1 of 82 troop pages. What blocks them: the faces
  (`ChangeFaceGraphic`, 831 uses, which drag along the page's messages),
  `\N[n]` and the escapes `\.`, `\!` and `\|` in the middle of a box,
  `PlayMovie` and `EnterHeroName`.
- **Next to the original**: it starts on map 2 because 1 doesn't build,
  and the title screen is the same as the original. With the survey's four
  recommended fixes, it is one of the three that would have a playable
  cartridge without crutches.
- **Its own**: map 1 could be split by a patch of the game.

## What changed after it (to 2026-10-06)

- **The window with more than 15 colors**: Adeleine reduces it, 18 colors
  down to 15, but the actor choice goes past `$4800`, and its System has 26
  colors in the 8bpp windows of the text screens. (Task
  [`window-with-more-than-15-colors`](https://github.com/lautarodragan/the-advocate-work/blob/main/tasks/window-with-more-than-15-colors.md).)
- **Faces and wait escapes**: `ChangeFaceGraphic` is accepted as a debt,
  without drawing the face, and the escapes in the middle of a box are
  dropped. The opening scene of map 2 now runs (Jack's dialogue), **but**
  with more pages compiling the sample directory went over 255 entries
  (263) and the cartridge didn't build: maps 40 to 93 were excluded in the
  project to build it. (Task [`faces-and-wait-escapes-in-messages`](https://github.com/lautarodragan/the-advocate-work/blob/main/tasks/faces-and-wait-escapes-in-messages.md).)
- **The samples left over don't sound**: past 255 samples the least used
  are left out with a warning. The real cause in Dooms 2 wasn't that —it
  had 247 keys or fewer— but the copies filling the directory; with that
  fixed it builds with maps 40 to 93, starts and shows the dialogue. (Task
  [`surplus-samples-dont-play`](https://github.com/lautarodragan/the-advocate-work/blob/main/tasks/surplus-samples-dont-play.md).)
- **Color codes ignored**, as a debt, `\S[n]` among them. (Task
  [`ignore-the-color-codes-in-messages-for-now`](https://github.com/lautarodragan/the-advocate-work/blob/main/tasks/ignore-the-color-codes-in-messages-for-now.md).)
- **The names that don't fit in the menu's bank**: not done; degrading
  them is deciding what is cut or left out. (Task
  [`degrade-instead-of-failing`](https://github.com/lautarodragan/the-advocate-work/blob/main/tasks/degrade-instead-of-failing.md).)
- **BMP images**: the task to read them is open. (Task
  [`images-in-bmp`](https://github.com/lautarodragan/the-advocate-work/blob/main/tasks/images-in-bmp.md).)
- **Decorative events as background**: 39 candidates, measured without
  looking at the drawing. (Task [`decorative-events-into-the-background`](https://github.com/lautarodragan/the-advocate-work/blob/main/tasks/decorative-events-into-the-background.md).)

The tasks named here are in `tasks/testing/` in the-advocate-work.
